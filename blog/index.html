					<h6>[TVCG'11-01] J. Stott et al., Automatic Metro Map Layout Using Multicriteria Optimization</h6>
					<p>
						Automatic metro map generation via snapping stations on grid then hill-climbing according to certain criteria. <br/>
						Many possibilities for modifying criteria. Maybe can apply extension to make better visible in crowded regions such as central Sydney or other cities with more complex networks? <br/>
						Also, might be able to group edges in railroad network by represented shape (line segment, small arc, or the combination of two, and alignment...) to represent metro maps with curvature (e.g. JR Yamanote line in Tokyo)
